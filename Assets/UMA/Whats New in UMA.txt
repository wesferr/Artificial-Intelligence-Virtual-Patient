This update has 2 years of production usage. This includes numerous speed improvements, 
many bug fixes and stability improvements. There are way too many to list all, but here are the hightlights:

New features:

Updated Skins
Speed improvements switching to native arrays in various places
New Materials used
Compatibility across Built-in, URP and HDRP
New "Simple Setup" scene to customize as a base character editor
Many Blendshape fixes and changes
Reorganized inspectors, greatly enhanced Avatar inspector, including:
Ability to add multiple recipes, enable disable them, filter them.
Ability to add DNA in editor
Able to set "base" colors in color editor
Get directly to race, race recipe, DNA Converters, and Boneposes
New compositing textures to lower VRAM usage
Faster building
Greatly enhanced utilities in the global library
Dynamic compression for hair, based on clipping plane(s)
Filters to limit asset searches to ease library rebuild
Photoshop style blend modes for combining textures
Material animator
New HumanBoy/HumanGirl races (compatible with HumanMale, HumanFemale)
Favorites window
New attachment options to ease holding items.
Significantly smaller bundles when using Addressables (removes material references and slot references where not required)
Added Addressable Build sample to show how to build smallest bundles and rebuild/label items in build script to address various issues with larger art teams.
Ability to recalculate normals during build
Added Burst support
Fixed man multi-culture issues with strings
Fixed AvatarDefinition to save Shader Parameter blocks with colors
Lowered size of AvatarDefinition String
Enable/disable slots in recipe editor for testing
Added integrated tags editor into recipe editors
Ability to match/hide by tags, simplifying process drastically
Drag and drop recipe merging
Fixed photobooth to work with SRPs

New Tools:

Texture combiner - for combining texture channels
Normal Viewer - see where the normals are after combining
Convert slots to meshes
Welding - Tools to copy vertex normals, bone weights from slots to match pieces together, or update weighting on slots without changing vertex count or order.

For asset creators/developers

Multi-SRP compatiblity on materials.
Multi-SRP materials shipped with UMA.
Added "Second pass material" to UMAMaterial to emulate mult-pass shaders
Override textures, bones, and vertexes by character (helpful for 3rd party avatar tools).
New Material Types - to use existing textures, or use existing materials - these modes are useful for customizable characters without generating rendertextures (much faster, but less customizable).
Meshcombiner tracks where every slot is inside the generated mesh, so you can get to the vertexes directly if needed. Also tracks where textures are placed in the Atlas.
This will likely be the last major release of UMA 2 (bugfix releases are of course possible), with all future enhancements going into UMA 3, which will retain asset compatibility.
